# A8: Vertical prototype

Our product is a social network that allows users to create new relationships, making it easier to share moments with friends, and connecting people in a fun way.

The Vertical Prototype includes the implementation of two or more user stories (the simplest) and aims to validate the architecture presented, also serving to gain familiarity with the technologies used in the project.
