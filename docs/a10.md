# A10: Presentation
## 1. Product presentation

Our product is a social network that allows users to create new relationships, making it easier to share moments with friends, and connecting people in a fun way.

We've implemented many features to facilitate this, such as post creation, rating and comments.
To create relationships we've added friend groups, direct messages and personalised profiles.
To find all this you can use our product's search feature!
Finally, to make sure our platforms rules are not broken we have a full moderator system regulated by our administrators.
