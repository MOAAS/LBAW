| BR06 | Can't self add to Group | A User can't add himself to a Group |

### A1.2. Technical requirements

| **Identifier** | **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TR01 | **Usability** | The user interface should be intuitive and not too elaborate, so that it doesn't overwhelm the user. |
| TR02 | **Security** | There should be a robust security system in effect that protects individual's data from unauthenticated peers and only allow access to those authorized. |
| TR03 | **Scalability** | The system should be prepared to deal with an exponentially increasing number of users. |
| TR04 | Availability | The system must be available 99 percent of the time in each 24-hour period |
| TR05 | Accessibility | The system must ensure that everyone can access the pages, regardless of whether they have any handicap or not, or the Web browser they use. |
| TR06 | Performance | The system should have response times shorter than 2s to ensure the user's attention. |
| TR07 | Web application | The system should be implemented as a Web application with dynamic pages (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3 and PHP). |
| TR08 | Portability | The server-side system should work across multiple platforms (Linux, Mac OS, etc.) |
| TR09 | Database | The PostgreSQL 9.4 database management system must be used. |
| TR10 | Robustness | The system must be prepared to handle and continue operating when runtime errors occur. |
| TR11 | Ethics | The system must respect the ethical principles in software development (for example, the password must be stored encrypted to ensure that only the owner knows it). |

In our opinion, the 3 most important technical requirements for our work are usability (so our users feel comfortable and at ease with the UI we provide), data security and scalability (seen as a social network is often a rapidly growing website).
